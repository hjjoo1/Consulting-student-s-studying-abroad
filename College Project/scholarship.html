						<h3>Erin Tierney Kramp Encouragement Endowed Scholarship</h3>
						<p>The Erin Tierney Kramp Encouragement Endowed Scholarship was established in 1999 by the ETK Encouragement Foundation and the Dallas/Fort Worth Private Equity Forum in memory of a courageous individual, Erin Tierney Kramp. In 1994, Erin Tierney Kramp was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 33. Soon after her diagnosis, Erin decided to fight cancer head-on. Erin began by searching for medical specialists often calling and flying all over the country to seek their knowledge and advice. She studied alternative treatment plans and examined state of the art, sometimes unproven methods, to battle the disease. Erin’s tenacity often frustrated her medical doctors and sometimes resulted in seeking new ones who were up to the challenge Erin demanded. With no map to guide her, she set her own course.
							Erin embarked on an aggressive treatment plan and over the next few years faced one medical adversity after another, her body often shutting down while her mind continued to race forward. Always demonstrating tremendous courage, perseverance and spirituality, Erin never shied away from her challenge. Throughout this struggle, Erin touched many lives and was an inspiration to those who knew her and to millions who read her book, Living with the End in Mind, or saw her on national television programs such as “20/20” and “The Oprah Winfrey Show”. She was also featured on the national broadcast of James Dobson’s “Focus on the Family” radio show. The Erin Tierney Kramp Program awards scholarships to students based upon their courage and perseverance in the face of adversity. Eligible applicants include high school seniors who will graduate in the spring and current students attending any of the seven Dallas County Community Colleges. Recipients of the Erin Tierney Kramp Encouragement Endowed Scholarship will receive funds for tuition and books for six consecutive semesters.
							In addition to tuition and books, recipients also get access to a Life Skills Mentor to provide support and be a resource for recipients to achieve their academic, personal and professional potential. Life Skills Mentors and recipients develop a close relationship through planned cultural, political and social events scheduled throughout the year.
							Kramp recipients are also eligible to apply for The Erin Tierney Kramp Emergency Grant which was established to provide immediate financial support for ETK scholarship recipients experiencing temporary financial hardship up to a maximum of $1,000. These funds are to be used when no other sources of assistance can be accessed. An award from this fund does not require repayment and should not be considered a loan.
							Recipients of the Erin Tierney Kramp Encouragement Endowed Scholarship are also eligible to continue their college education beyond the 6 semesters at DCCCD. Visit https://www.foundation.dcccd.edu/scholarship-and-students/event-scholarships for details. </p>
